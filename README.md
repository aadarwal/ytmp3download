# ytmp3download
Download lists of YT videos as MP3s- mainly for range of songs. 

I use this primarily for downloading many videos when I want to include the songs as MP3s for either projects or making larger videos. Also, if you have an external device, like a Garmin, which doesnt enable Apple Music access this is pretty cool for downloading the songs onto the device in the quickest way possible because I just enter all the names I want and get them uploaded to my watch. 

Notes: This uses ytmp3.cc for downloading and tries to skip ads as much as possible in the youtube search results.
